    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The Ganesh Temple at Ganpatipule in Ratnagiri district of Kokan, which is located at a distance of 350 kms from Mumbai,<br>
    is very ancient, right from the Peshwas. In ancient literature like Mudgal-puran etc.,<br>
    this Lambodara's (Ganesh) temple is being referred to as "Paschim Dwar-Devata" (Western Sentinel God).<br><br>
    
    Various myths are prevalent about the temples and deities in Kokan.<br>
    Ganpatipule is one of the "Ashta Dwar Devatas" (Eight Welcoming Deities) of the subcontinent and is known as the Western Sentinel God.<br>
    Pandanus Odoratissimus. During the reign of Mughals (about 1600 years before), there was a 'kevada' (Flower tree) jungle at the foot of the hill where the temple of 'Swayambhu' Ganapati is presently situated.<br>
    Here lived Balbhatji Bhide, a Brahmin, who was the renter of the village. During the Mughal period, Bhide encountered a major personal problem.<br>
    Bhide, being a determined person that he was, made up his mind to give up food and water until being relieved of personal calamity.<br>
    He stayed in the Kevada-Jungal for penance and worshiped his tutelar deity 'Mangalmurti' (Lord Ganesh).<br>
    During this period, Bhide had a vision about Lord Ganesh who said, "I have come to Aagargule (Ganesh Gule) to fulfill the wishes of my devotees. The hill is my 'nirakar' form (Void form).</br> <br>You worship and propitiate here, and will be relieved of all your difficulties"</br>.<br>
    During the same period, one of the cows of Bhide was not giving milk, for which reason, the cowherd kept a close watch on her. He was astonished to see that the milk was flowing from the cow's udder to the place where the idol of the God is presently placed.</br><br> The cowherd narrated the incident to Bhide. Upon cleaning up the entire area, Bhide found the idol of Ganesh which he had seen in his vision. He built a shrine here and started performing rituals.<br>
    Ganpatipule derived its name from "Ganapati" or the Lord of "Ganas" (army) and 'Pule' which means sand dune. In those days, this village was sparsely populated. Mostly people stayed around the northern part of the village since the western part of the village was a slope.<br>
    The tutelar deity Lord Mangalmurty preferred to be at a small village adjacent to the western coast of India along the Arabian Sea.</p>
